## 🛠 How It Works  

The **ETL pipeline** follows a structured three-step process:  

1️⃣ **Extract** – The scraper fetches real estate listings from Redfin using **BeautifulSoup and Requests**. It dynamically navigates search results, pulling information such as price, location, square footage, and property type.  

2️⃣ **Transform** – The raw data undergoes **data cleaning, formatting, and structuring** to ensure consistency. This includes handling missing values, normalizing price formats, and geospatial data processing.  

3️⃣ **Load** – The cleaned data is **stored** in **CSV, JSON, or a database** for further analysis. The structured format makes it easy to apply machine learning models, perform time-series analysis, or visualize market trends.
